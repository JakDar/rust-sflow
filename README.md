sFlow is owned by [InMon](http://www.inmon.com) and [licensed](http://www.inmon.com/technology/sflowlicense.txt) for public use. As this is an open source project it will do its best to adhere to the specification as written while still providing workarounds as needed. The underlying protocol is implemented but not all record types are currently implemented.
